                    <li>Grooving to hiphop music: I don't usually go a day without music and hiphop get a good amount of play time for me.</li>
                    <li>Learning to code: I love to spend my leisure taking on more programming challenges to grow my coding muscles.</li>
                    <li>Practicing yoga: I'm a big fan of stretching and love the aftereffects of major yoga poses.</li>
                    <li>Competitive Research: At this point, as an independent publisher, I love to spend extra time on my hands to assess my 
                        competitors and build competitive advantage to either close up the gap between myself and my competitors or to get further 
                        ahead of the pack.</li>
